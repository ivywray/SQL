#From Khan Acadamy Project: App impersonator 

#Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.

#CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.
