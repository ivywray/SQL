Using a database of Netflix movie and TV shows, I have queried code to answer the questions below. 

1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)

SELECT people.show_id,
people.cast,
titles.title,
titles.duration,
titles.rating
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id;

2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?

SELECT count (*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type = 'Movie';

3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

SELECT MAX (date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?

SELECT title
FROM  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
ORDER BY title;

5.What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
WHERE titles.title='Bright Star';

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie' 
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;
